## Team Name: Kicking Kangaroos

In this project the team scraped data from Indeed to determine the total number of data scientist job openings by companies throughout the United States. Data was also scraped from Zillow to determine housing prices in different cities where there is a high demand for data scientists.

Data was extracted into csv files, transformed (cleaned), and loaded to a database (PostgreSQL).
